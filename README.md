# zip-archive-tool
A VERY rudimentary tool that can ZIP files on the web.

*This wasn't built to look good; it was built for me to learn and for it to work (I hope).*

---

This is built around ZIP 6.3.10 (see [APPNOTE-6.3.10.txt](https://pkwaredownloads.blob.core.windows.net/pem/APPNOTE-6.3.10.txt)).

I built this tool to learn how very basic ZIP archives work and are structured (so no compression or encryption).
